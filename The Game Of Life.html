    <h1>The Game of Life</h1> 
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>The Grid represents an environment and each box is a unit.  If you click a box, it will turn green.  Green boxes represent living cells, white ones represent vacant areas.  Each frame time passes and cells will live, die, or reproduce based on a set of criterian. Fill some cells and press start to watch the simulation, or press next frame to go forward a single unit of time</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a cell has 2 or 3 neighbors it will survive the turn</li>
            <li>If a cell has more than 3 neighbors, it will die due to overpopulation</li>
            <li>If a cell has fewer than 2 neighbors, it will die due to isolation</li>
            <li>If an empty square has 3 neighbors, it will become occupied due to reproduction</li>
        </ul>
